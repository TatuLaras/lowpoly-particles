# Low poly particles (Unity only)
Some particles that fit the low poly style and are performant. Free to use, no attribution required. To use them just download the zip file and export it to somewhere in your Unity project.

The particles are from my VR game project, The Gargantuan Beasts. It is no longer in active development, but devlogs of it can be found on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe4W4h7vUHK8RQ2yEggpwJw).
